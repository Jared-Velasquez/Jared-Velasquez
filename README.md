## Hi, I'm Jared! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an incoming M.S. CS student studying software systems at UCLA. I am highly interested in backend engineering, software architecture, and cloud computing. Currently, I intern at AEG Worldwide and construct Data Maestro, my department's first cloud-native application written in-house for internal use in logging financial transactions.

### Currently...
- I am interning as an Application Developer Intern at AEG Worldwide. I architected and implemented Data Maestro, my department's first cloud-native application written in-house for internal use in logging financial transactions. I use Azure Functions (TypeScript) in a CQRS-style architecture deployed on Azure.
- I am architecting and implementing the backend of Liwanag, a Tagalog language learning mobile app developed by students at Pilipinos in Engineering and Science (PIES) @ UCLA. I use Java Spring and FastAPI frameworks in an event-driven microservices-style architecture deployed on AWS.

If you love developing and deploying servers, drawing out software architecture, or exploring the full capabilities of cloud services, please contact me!
