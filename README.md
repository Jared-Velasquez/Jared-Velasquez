## Hi, I'm Jared! 👋
I'm an incoming M.S. CS student studying software systems at UCLA. I am highly interested in backend engineering, software architecture, and cloud computing.

### Currently...
- 💻 I am interning as an Application Developer Intern at [AEG Worldwide](https://aegworldwide.com/). I architected and implemented Data Maestro, my department's first cloud-native application written in-house for internal use in logging financial transactions. I use Azure Functions (TypeScript) in a CQRS-style architecture deployed on Azure.
- 🍃 I am architecting and implementing the backend of Liwanag, a Tagalog language learning mobile app developed by students at Pilipinos in Engineering and Science (PIES) @ UCLA. I use Java Spring and FastAPI frameworks in an event-driven microservices-style architecture deployed on AWS.
- 🇵🇭 I am an organizer for [Kapwa Codefest](https://kapwacodefest.com/), a virtual hackathon led by students from UofM Dearborn, UCLA, UCI, UCSD, BU, Vanderbilt, Purdue, and Wayne. This hackathon enables students to develop projects and solve challenges for Filipino businesses during Filipino-American History Month. [Join now!](https://kapwacodefest.com/)
